TWEAKS:
[x] Improve efficiency of HasamiShogiGame (lots of get square occupant calls)
    [x] Add a Piece class that each player stores
        Each Piece always knows all of its possible moves
        Each time a Piece is moved, it should figure out what its possible moves must be without iterating in all directions

    [x] Or instead of copying the board each time, create an "undo move" function

[x] Improve capture heuristic in tradeoff cases where one of the opponent's capturing pieces will be captured first
    Game example: i6e6, a5e5 (RED should avoid that last move but currently it evaluates to a 0 heuristic)

[ ] Maybe moderate AI aggression based on how far in the lead?

[x] Re-evaluate capture heuristic
    I've been assuming score is positive, but tradeoff can be negative.
    Score needs to represent net material gain for active player.

[X] Move tracking pieces by color to GameBoard, away from Player.

[ ] Idea: "Grouping" class, owned by HasamiShogiGame or GameBoard, that keeps
    track of adjacent blocks of similar colored squares. Knows the two ends that
     will capture it, including case of corner square. Knows when a member
     leaves and how to split the Grouping into two smaller Groupings accordingly
     .

FEATURES:
[ ] Add difficulty selector
[ ] Add rules screen
